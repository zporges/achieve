-1;How Many Sets Should I Do?
1;More than twenty five sets in a workout can either be overkill -LRB- doing more harm than good -RRB- or you 're not working yourself hard enough -LRB- boo inefficiency -RRB-.
1;Add weight or change the exercise so that it 's tougher.
-1;Although I 'm currently following a variation of Mark Rippetoe 's Starting Strength -LRB- 2nd edition -RRB- routine -LRB- heavy weight at five reps per set -RRB-, I 'll be switching to this type of routine in the next few weeks : Low reps -LRB- 5-8 -RRB- and heavy weight on Mondays.
-1;Reps in the 6-12 range build a somewhat equal amounts of muscular strength and muscular endurance.
1;By doing rep ranges at each of these different increments, you 're building well-rounded, balanced muscles -- full of endurance, explosive power, and strength.
-1;10 reps at 70 pound dumbbells, rest 90 seconds.
-1;8 reps at 75 pound dumbbells, rest 90 seconds.
1;This one is easy : lift enough so that you can get through the set, but not too much that you have NO fuel left in the tank at the end.
1;When just starting out, or if you 're doing a new exercise for the first time, always err on the side of caution.
-1;Maybe you want to build some cardio into your weight training.

1;If you 're cleaning at night, turn on all of the lights.

1;Taking a break to eat, drink, and kick up your heels is often a good idea.
1;However, do n't let yourself become too distracted during your break!
1;Having a reward to motivate you will get you through the cleaning process quicker.
1;However, do n't make your reward so tempting that you speed through cleaning without doing a really thorough job.
-1;You 'll be surprised how fast you 'll start focusing on your scene, while still cleaning.
1;Think of your bed as your island of clean in your ocean of mess.
1;Make your bed back up with fresh sheets.

-1;You may be surprised to find just how much junk has accumulated there, much of which is probably stuff you thought you 'd lost or may have forgotten about.
1;Separate it into piles : trash, stuff to giveaway to charities, things to sell to second hand stores, stuff to give to your siblings -LRB- if you have any -RRB- or friends, stuff that belongs elsewhere, and stuff that stays in your room.
1;If you have any giant piles, sort them into subcategories -LRB- clothes, shoes, books etc -RRB- before you begin to put them away.
1;If they belong in a different house, put them somewhere that you 'll remember.
-1;Next, the ` give to siblings / friends ' pile.
1;Gather all the stuff you want to give to charity and the stuff to sell in two separate bags.
