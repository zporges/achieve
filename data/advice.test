-1;Resources Apparel Search How To Build Your Own Workout Routine By Steve on February 15, 2010 177 What should I do for a workout?
-1;If so, keep doing it!
-1;If you can do an hour a day, that 's awesome.
1;Keep it simple, stupid.
-1;Push -LRB- chest, shoulders, and triceps -RRB- - overhead press, bench press, incline dumbbell press, push ups, dips.
-1;Core -LRB- abs and lower back -RRB- -- planks, side planks, exercise ball crunches, mountain climbers, jumping knee tucks, hanging leg raises.
1;Try lunges on Wednesday and box jumps on Friday.
-1;A Monday-Wednesday-Friday workout works well to ensure enough time to recover.
-1;How Many Sets Should I Do?
1;Keep your total workout number of sets for all exercises is in the 15-25 set range -LRB- 5 or 6 exercises of four sets is a good start -RRB-.
-1;How Many Repetitions Should I Do?
1;If you can do more than 15 without much of a challenge, it 's not difficult enough for you.
1;If you 're looking to build size and strength, you should vary your rep ranges depending on the workout.
-1;Although I 'm currently following a variation of Mark Rippetoe 's Starting Strength -LRB- 2nd edition -RRB- routine -LRB- heavy weight at five reps per set -RRB-, I 'll be switching to this type of routine in the next few weeks : Low reps -LRB- 5-8 -RRB- and heavy weight on Mondays.
-1;High reps -LRB- 12-15 -RRB- and lower weight on Wednesdays.
-1;Reps in the 1-5 range build super dense muscle and strength -LRB- called myofibrillar hypertrophy -RRB-.
-1;Reps in the 6-12 range build a somewhat equal amounts of muscular strength and muscular endurance.
1;By doing rep ranges at each of these different increments, you 're building well-rounded, balanced muscles -- full of endurance, explosive power, and strength.
-1;I purchased The Men 's Health Big Book of Exercises, which is a great book LOADED with exercises, tons of pictures, and routines.
-1;Now, factor in a five or ten minute warm-up, and then stretching afterwards, and the workout can go a little bit longer.
1;If you can go for over an hour and you 're not completely worn out, you 're simply not pushing yourself hard enough.
1;Less time, more intensity, better results.
-1;Maybe you want to build some cardio into your weight training.
-1;That 's where these next two sections come in.
1;Try this instead : Do a set of squats, wait one minute, then do a set of dumbbell presses, wait one minute, then do your next set of squats, and so on.
1;If music does n't help you concentrate, try listening to a book or a podcast.
1;Be careful not to choose something that will distract you, though!
1;Setting your iPod to shuffle will help you get the job done faster.
1;Write down a list of all the areas, shelves, or things that need to be cleaned.
1;It is best to take a break after you have completed an entire task, rather than in the middle of it.
1;If you like to act, and ca n't seem to get motivated to clean your room, try making up a scene where your character is cleaning.
-1;Not only will making your bed allow you to feel like you have accomplished something already, it will also give you a flat surface to fold clothes on and take breaks on.
1;Think of your bed as your island of clean in your ocean of mess.
1;Flipping over your mattress will not only increase its lifespan, but it will also feel great to sleep on the under-used side.
1;Make your bed back up with fresh sheets.
1;Throw your dirty sheets in the hamper or the wash.
1;Start with the bigger things, like books and pillows, then move onto smaller things, like pencils and other stationary.
1;If you find anything else that goes in another room, put in a separate box and take it away after you are done cleaning your room.
1;Also look under the rest of your furniture like your desk, dresser, end tables, nightstands or bookshelves.
-1;2Attack the separate piles, but leave the ` keep ' pile for now.
1;If you have any giant piles, sort them into subcategories -LRB- clothes, shoes, books etc -RRB- before you begin to put them away.
1;Put the items that ca n't be recycled in the bin, then the items that can into the recycling bin.
1;Immediately take the siblings items to them -LRB- if you live with them, if not, put them with the ` friends ' pile -RRB-.
-1;2-Look at your beautifully clean room ... Cleaning a room -LRB- your room -RRB- really is n't as hard as you may think or believe.
1;Never sacrifice form for heavier weight.
